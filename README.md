> Perhaps this project will be different.
> Maybe this time, I'll conquer that pesky procrastination monster and
> emerge victorious, code gleaming and functionality flawless. Or
> maybe a squirrel will fly by my window and distract me for the next
> three hours. Honestly, at this point, the odds seem about even. But
> hey, a programmer can dream, can't they? Just don't tell my
> ever-expanding collection of unfinished projects. They might get
> jealous.
